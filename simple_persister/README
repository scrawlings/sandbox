Client Side Sandpit:

The underlying SinatraRB application provides two URLs for persistence.

GET /persisted/some_key Recovers data associated with the key "some_key".

POST /persist expects the post body to be a JSON string for a map. 

The data is stored in the ./db directory of the app using YAML from the Ruby standard library with file names corresponding to keys.

There are two demonstration pages /persist.html and /recover.html which exercise the two persistence URLs.
